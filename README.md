> [!NOTE]  
> The `dispatchTouchEvent` hook may not work in some Unity games because Unity can override or bypass the Android input pipeline, or use the newer InputSystem, meaning touch events never reach the Activity.  
> Some games also modify their internal input structure, which can lead to incorrect coordinates or missing events.  
>  
> You may need to use a different input method depending on the game.  
> **I will not provide support for implementing or integrating any alternative touch-input methods.**
